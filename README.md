Design and development of the Authentic News Verification System, an automated platform engineered to actively combat the rapid dissemination of misinformation by serving users a feed of demonstrably AI-verified and credibility-scored articles. The system utilizes a novel hybrid architecture, integrating a secure Django full-stack web application with an external automation service. The core of the system is the multi-stage verification algorithm. Incoming news from multiple RSS feeds is subjected to an AI Agent that functions as an expert fact-checker, leveraging search capabilities to cross-verify claims against multiple authentic and up-to-date online sources. The model returns a structured output that includes a Credibility Score and a verification verdict. Only articles surpassing a strict threshold pass the subsequent filter gate, ensuring that only trustworthy news proceeds for publication. The output is then transmitted via a secure POST API endpoint to the Django database, which enforces duplication control, schema validation, and API security.

Additionally, the system features an interactive front-end interface where verified news articles are dynamically categorized, displayed, and updated in real-time. It integrates a weather widget and topic-based sections to enhance user experience. A connected Zapier automation workflow manages email notifications, instantly alerting subscribers about newly verified content. User subscription details are securely stored through Google Sheets integration, enabling efficient subscriber tracking and engagement. The modular workflow allows scalability for integrating additional AI models, news APIs, and cloud-based analytics in the future. By transparently displaying each articleâ€™s credibility insights and verification details, the project fosters public trust, promotes media literacy, and establishes a sustainable, intelligent framework for responsible digital journalism.
